Hello i'm BreadEater, a self-taught fullstack developer that love developping for fun and not for profits, the only thing missing for me to be good is patience, im not patient at all atleast for irl stuff.

Im a chill guy, a bit of annoying sometimes but i'am like that and i can't really do much about it.
For the rest of the presentation down below, there might be swearing words but dont take it the wrong way, im just being honest and truely telling what i feel about something.
<br><br>

### ❔ Why i started coding
Because i was curious about how websites works and wanted to learn how to use devtools.

### 📖 What programming language i learned first
I learned HTML and CSS (if we can call them languages because they aren't really programming languages).

### 💻 Programming languages i know / use
- HTML/CSS/JS
- JavaScript (server side using NodeJS and client side)
- TypeScript
- PHP
- SQL
- Shell scripts (bash for linux and batch for windows)
- JSON
- C/C++ (just a little bit, just because im curious)
- x86 Assembly (just for curiosity, but let me tell you, i would NEVER EVER use this language for my projects, why ?, because its like someone tells you to build a fancy house but without any resources and tools, you're fucked)
- Java (i use it for doing custom minecraft plugins or little tools, thats all)

### 🗃️ My projects
I do projects but the majority of the time i stop working on them due to losing motivation, the only public project i work on is a minecraft server that i host and develop for someone.

### 🗃️ About my public repositories
You can contribute as much as you want, getting help from more talented developpers kinda help me to get motivation to continue a project instead of drop it because i work too much on it (like till i crack and say myself: im done with this shit)

### 📫 How to contact me
You can contact me at contact@breadeater.fr if you want some help from me or just want to ask something.
